**⚠️ IMMEDIATE DANGER:**

This appears to be a SCAM attempt! The contact you described shows multiple warning signs of fraud targeting seniors.

**🎯 Red Flags Detected:**

• {chr(10).join([f"• {indicator}" for indicator in risk_indicators])}

**🛡️ What You Should Do RIGHT NOW:**

1. **DO NOT share any personal information** - Never give out Social Security numbers, bank account details, passwords, or credit card information
2. **HANG UP immediately** - Do not continue the conversation
3. **DO NOT make any payments** - Legitimate organizations do not demand immediate payment with gift cards, wire transfers, or Bitcoin
4. **Block the number** - Prevent them from calling again

**📞 Who to Contact:**

• **Call your bank directly** using the number on your card or statement (NOT the number the caller gave you)
• **Report to authorities:** Call your local police non-emergency line
• **Report to FTC:** Call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357)
• **Tell a trusted family member** - They should know about this attempt

**🔒 Remember:**

• Real government agencies (IRS, Social Security) do NOT call demanding immediate payment
• Your bank already knows your account information - they won't ask for it over the phone
• Microsoft/Apple do NOT call about computer problems
• Medicare will NEVER call asking for your number

**✅ You did the RIGHT THING by checking with me first!**

Stay safe and trust your instincts. When in doubt, hang up and call the official number."""

**🤔 What This Means:**

The contact you described has some warning signs that suggest it could be suspicious. While not definitely a scam, it's important to verify before taking any action.

**🔍 Concerns Identified:**

• {chr(10).join([f"• {indicator}" for indicator in risk_indicators])}

**✅ Steps to Verify Safely:**

1. **Don't act immediately** - Legitimate businesses won't pressure you for instant decisions
2. **Verify independently** - Call the company using the official number from your bill, statement, or their website
3. **Ask for details** - Get the caller's name, company, and callback number
4. **Check with family** - Discuss with a trusted family member or friend before making decisions

**📋 Questions to Ask:**

• "Can you send me information in writing?"
• "What is your company's official phone number?"
• "Can I call you back after I verify this?"
• "Why is this urgent/time-sensitive?"

**🚨 If They Pressure You:**

This becomes a RED FLAG. Legitimate companies understand the need to verify and won't pressure elderly customers.

**💡 General Safety Tips:**

• Never give personal information to unsolicited callers
• Take time to think and consult others
• When in doubt, hang up and call the official number
• Trust your instincts - if something feels wrong, it probably is

**✅ You're Being Smart:**

By checking on this contact, you're protecting yourself the right way. Always verify before you trust!"""

**📝 Initial Assessment:**

Based on the information you provided, this contact appears to be legitimate. However, it's always wise to remain cautious with any unsolicited contact.

**🛡️ Smart Safety Practices:**

**For Phone Calls:**
• Verify the caller by hanging up and calling the official company number
• Never give personal information immediately, even if the call seems legitimate
• Ask for written confirmation of any changes to accounts or services

**For Emails:**
• Check the sender's email address carefully for misspellings
• Don't click links - go directly to the company's official website
• Be wary of urgent language or immediate action requests

**For Mail:**
• Verify through official channels before responding to unexpected offers
• Shred documents containing personal information
• Be cautious of "pre-approved" credit offers

**📞 When to Call for Help:**

• If the caller becomes pushy or aggressive
• If they ask for immediate payment or personal information
• If something doesn't feel right, even if you can't explain why
• If they claim there's an emergency involving family members

**👥 Stay Connected:**

• Share information about suspicious contacts with family members
• Report potential scams to help protect other seniors
• Keep important phone numbers handy for quick verification

**💪 You're Doing Great:**
